# Open Theater Trigger Server Demo

A minimal demo server setup for the <a href="https://gitlab.com/open-theater/open-theater-api">Open Theater API</a>'s Trigger API.

Receives trigger payloads from an Open Theater compatible Cueing Software and/or the adapter app (**todo: link repo!**) and broadcasts those to all clients, who registered at the trigger server's endpoint

This is meant as a demo implementation to get started on your own Open Theater trigger server.

Check out the other Open Theater repositories linked <a href="https://gitlab.com/open-theater/open-theater-api">in the Open Theater API repo</a> to get started.
